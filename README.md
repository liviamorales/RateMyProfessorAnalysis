# Professor Effectiveness Data Analysis
*NYU Data Science Capstone Project*

## Overview
This project analyzes RateMyProfessor data to assess whether factors like gender, course difficulty, and teaching modality impact student ratings of professors. Statistical testing and regression models are applied to assess potential biases and predictors of higher professor ratings.

## Key Analyses
- Assessed gender bias in student evaluations
- Examined the impact of course difficulty on professor ratings
- Compared ratings for online vs. in-person teaching
- Evaluated the influence of "pepper" status and likelihood of retaking the class
- Built regression and classification models to predict professor ratings and pepper status

- `Capstone_Code.py`: Python script with data cleaning, analysis, and modeling
- `Capstone Project.pdf`: Full project report with methodology, results, and figures

## Tools & Libraries
### Languages & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

### Statistical Methods
- Mann-Whitney U Test
- Pearson & Spearman Correlation
- Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple)
- Logistic Regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Limitations
- RateMyProfessor data may reflect self-selection bias
- Number of ratings is an imperfect proxy for teaching experience
- Treating ordinal ratings as continuous in regression models introduces assumptions
